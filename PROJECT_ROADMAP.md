## üìù Notes

### Why This Order?
1. **Complete Migration First**: Move all salvageable compositions while the app is stable
2. **Leverage Manim**: Create new value with existing video assets
3. **Add Testing**: Ensure stability before adding complexity
4. **Production Features**: Enable actual video creation workflow
5. **Documentation**: Capture learnings for future development
6. **Enhancement**: Improve after foundation is solid

### Key Principles
- Test after each addition
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Avoid complex webpack configurations
- Document what works and what doesn't
- Commit working states frequently

### Available Manim Videos
- `SineWaveAnimation_480p15_20250902_220341.mp4`
- `CircleAreaDemo_480p15_20250902_222354.mp4`
- `TestAnimation_480p15_20250902_220232.mp4`
