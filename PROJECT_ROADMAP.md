# Remotion Recovery - Project Roadmap & Migration Plan

## Current Status (Week of September 11, 2025)

### Project Health
- **remotion-recovery**: ‚úÖ ACTIVE & FUNCTIONAL (Primary)
- **remotion-app**: ‚ùå BROKEN & DEPRECATED (Reference only)

### Key Discoveries
- ManimShowcase gallery EXISTS and WORKS in recovery project
- Original project has catastrophic Node.js/webpack failures
- Week 3 Performance Optimization CAN proceed as planned

---

## üìÖ 8-Week Migration & Development Roadmap

### Week 1-2: Assessment & Harvesting (Current)
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

#### Objectives
- [x] Identify project status confusion
- [x] Document broken vs working components
- [ ] Create comprehensive harvest list
- [ ] Test migration procedures

#### Harvestable Components from Original
```bash
# Safe to migrate (test first)
/src/compositions/Effects/          # Visual effects
/src/compositions/Promotional/      # Marketing templates  
/src/compositions/Educational/      # Teaching animations
/public/assets/                     # Static resources
/docs/                              # Documentation

# DO NOT migrate
/src/audio/                        # WebAssembly disaster
webpack.override.js                # Source of failures
/src/utils/*Node*                  # Node.js dependencies
```

#### Migration Testing Protocol
1. Identify component to migrate
2. Check for Node.js dependencies
3. Copy to test directory in recovery
4. Run isolated tests
5. Integrate if successful

### Week 3-4: Performance Optimization
**Target**: ManimShowcase Gallery (in recovery project)

#### Week 3a: Foundation & Safety
- [ ] Establish performance baselines
- [ ] Implement lazy loading (conservative)
- [ ] Add intersection observers
- [ ] Progressive image loading
- [ ] Virtual scrolling (if safe)

#### Week 3b: Advanced Optimization (Conditional)
- [ ] Predictive loading
- [ ] Adaptive quality
- [ ] Memory optimization
- [ ] Search performance
- [ ] Production monitoring

#### Success Criteria
- 60% load time improvement
- 60 FPS sustained scrolling
- <100MB memory for 20+ videos
- No core Remotion breakage

---

### Week 5-6: Feature Parity & Enhancement

#### Migration Completion
- [ ] All safe components migrated
- [ ] Test coverage >80%
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance validated

#### New Features (Post-Migration)
- [ ] Enhanced video controls
- [ ] Advanced filtering
- [ ] Playlist functionality
- [ ] Export capabilities

#### Quality Gates
- All tests passing
- No webpack errors
- Memory usage stable
- Performance targets met

---

### Week 7: Production Preparation

#### Final Migration Tasks
- [ ] Extract remaining documentation
- [ ] Archive useful code patterns
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Create migration guide

#### Production Readiness
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Deployment pipeline

#### Original Project Archival
```bash
# Create final backup
tar -czf remotion-app-final-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz remotion-app/

# Document what was salvaged
echo "Migrated components list" > MIGRATION_MANIFEST.md

# Verify backup integrity
tar -tzf remotion-app-final-backup-*.tar.gz | head
```

---

### Week 8: Project Sunset & Cleanup

#### Sunset Checklist
- [ ] Verify all valuable code migrated
- [ ] Confirm recovery project stability
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Remove original from CI/CD
- [ ] Archive to cold storage
- [ ] **DELETE original project directory**

#### Final Validation
```bash
# Ensure nothing references old project
grep -r "remotion-app" remotion-recovery/
# Should return no critical dependencies

# Verify recovery is self-sufficient
cd remotion-recovery
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev
```

#### Deletion Protocol
```bash
# Final backup verification
ls -la remotion-app-final-backup-*.tar.gz

# Remove original project
rm -rf remotion-app/

# Confirm deletion
ls -la | grep remotion-app
# Should return only backup file
```

## üéØ Key Milestones & Decision Points

### Milestone 1: Migration Feasibility (Week 2)
**Decision**: Which components are worth migrating?
- If >50% salvageable ‚Üí Continue migration
- If <50% salvageable ‚Üí Focus on new development

### Milestone 2: Performance Success (Week 4)
**Decision**: Did optimizations succeed without breaking core?
- If YES ‚Üí Continue with advanced features
- If NO ‚Üí Rollback and reassess approach

### Milestone 3: Feature Parity (Week 6)
**Decision**: Does recovery match/exceed original functionality?
- If YES ‚Üí Proceed to production prep
- If NO ‚Üí Extend timeline for completion

### Milestone 4: Production Ready (Week 7)
**Decision**: Is recovery project production ready?
- If YES ‚Üí Schedule original deletion
- If NO ‚Üí Delay sunset, fix issues

### Milestone 5: Safe Deletion (Week 8)
**Decision**: Can we safely delete original?
- Backup verified ‚úì
- Recovery stable ‚úì
- No dependencies ‚úì
- ‚Üí DELETE

## üö® Risk Management

### High Risk Items
1. **Accidental Node.js contamination** during migration
   - Mitigation: Strict testing protocol
   - Fallback: Immediate rollback

2. **Performance optimization breaks Remotion**
   - Mitigation: Phased approach with gates
   - Fallback: Feature flags for instant disable

3. **Missing critical functionality** after sunset
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive migration manifest
   - Fallback: Backup retrieval procedure

### Monitoring & Alerts
```javascript
// Add to recovery project
const PROJECT_HEALTH = {
  webpackErrors: 0,        // Must stay 0
  nodePolyfills: false,    // Must stay false
  memoryUsage: '<500MB',   // Monitor growth
  testPassRate: '>95%',    // Maintain quality
};
```
