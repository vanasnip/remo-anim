## 🔍 Verification Results by Specialist

### 1. Performance Engineer Assessment
**Verdict: Implementation Excellent, Metrics Need Validation**

#### Key Findings:
- ✅ **Solid Architecture**: Well-structured virtual scrolling, lazy loading, and performance monitoring
- ✅ **Progressive Enhancement**: Conservative fallbacks and feature toggles
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Proper TypeScript interfaces, error handling, and modular design
- ⚠️ **Metrics Caveat**: Performance tests use simulated delays rather than real DOM measurements

#### Realistic Performance Expectations:
| Metric | Claimed | Realistic Estimate |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Load Time | 42ms | 200-500ms |
| FPS | 60 FPS | 45-60 FPS |
| Memory | 83MB | 100-150MB |
| Search | 12ms | 15-50ms |

**Recommendation**: Replace simulated tests with real DOM timing measurements using `performance.timing` API.
