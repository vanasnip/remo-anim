# Remotion Recovery Project - Active Development

## üö® PROJECT STATUS: ACTIVE PRIMARY PROJECT

This is the **ACTIVE** Remotion project after recovery from the original project's critical failures.

### Project Context

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- Running on `localhost:3000` (Remotion Studio)
- Clean webpack configuration
- No Node.js polyfill issues
- Base Remotion setup complete
- Ready for feature implementation

**Original Project Status**: ‚ùå BROKEN (../remotion-app)
- Catastrophic Node.js/browser boundary violations
- webpack.override.js polyfill hell
- "node:" URI scheme errors
- Should be used ONLY for selective code harvesting

---

## Migration Strategy from Original Project

### ‚úÖ Safe to Harvest
1. **Pure React Components** (no Node.js dependencies)
   - UI components that don't use fs, path, crypto, etc.
   - Styled components and Material-UI implementations
   - Animation sequences that use only browser APIs

2. **Test Patterns** (adapted for new structure)
   - Jest test configurations
   - React Testing Library patterns
   - Performance test utilities

3. **Documentation**
   - Architecture decisions
   - API documentation
   - User guides

4. **Assets**
   - Images, videos, fonts
   - Manim output files
   - Static resources

### ‚ùå DO NOT Migrate
1. **webpack.override.js** - The source of all problems
2. **Audio Analysis System** - WebAssembly integration that broke everything
3. **Node.js Polyfills** - Any attempt to run Node modules in browser
4. **Complex Build Configurations** - Start fresh with simple configs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Migrate with Extreme Caution
1. **Utility Functions** - Test thoroughly in isolation first
2. **Custom Hooks** - Verify no Node.js dependencies
3. **Service Workers** - Check for filesystem access attempts
4. **External Integrations** - Validate browser compatibility

- [x] Verify development server runs correctly
- [x] Establish as primary project

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core Feature Implementation (COMPLETED)
- [x] **ManimShowcase Gallery**
  - [x] Implement gallery component structure
  - [x] Add Manim animation integration (3 real videos)
  - [x] Create showcase examples with search/filter
  - [x] Performance optimizations (lazy loading, virtual scrolling)
- [x] **Basic Compositions** 
  - [x] Set up 4 reusable composition templates
    - Educational Content Template
    - Tutorial Video Template
    - Product Demo Template
    - Animation Showcase Template

  - [ ] Optimize bundle size
  - [ ] Progressive loading for templates
  - [ ] Code splitting implementation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] **Audio Integration** (Clean implementation)
  - [ ] Browser-compatible audio analysis
  - [ ] Waveform visualization
  - [ ] Audio-reactive animations
- [ ] **Export Capabilities**
  - [ ] Video export optimization
  - [ ] Multiple format support
  - [ ] Batch processing

### Phase 4: Production Ready

## Current Development Focus

### ‚úÖ Recent Accomplishments (September 12, 2025)
1. **ManimShowcase Gallery** - Fully implemented with real Manim videos
2. **Composition Templates** - 4 reusable templates for quick video creation
3. **Asset Pipeline** - Set up with 3 working Manim animations
4. **Performance** - Lazy loading and virtual scrolling implemented

### üéØ Next Priority: Component Migration
**Goal**: Harvest valuable components from legacy project
1. Audit legacy/remotion-app for clean components
2. Test migrated components in isolation
3. Port test suites and adapt to new structure
4. Document migration decisions

### Important URLs
- **Dev Server**: http://localhost:3000
- **Remotion Studio**: http://localhost:3000
- **ManimShowcase Gallery**: http://localhost:3000 ‚Üí "ManimShowcase-Gallery"
- **Templates**: 
  - Template-Educational
  - Template-Tutorial
  - Template-ProductDemo
  - Template-AnimationShowcase

## Critical Reminders

1. **This IS the main project now** - remotion-recovery is not a backup, it's the primary
2. **Original project is reference only** - Do not run npm commands in original
3. **Test everything** - Any code from original must be thoroughly tested
4. **No Node.js in browser** - Maintain strict browser/Node.js separation
5. **Keep webpack simple** - Avoid complex polyfill configurations

---

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start development (THIS project)
npm run dev

# Never run in original project!
# cd ../remotion-app && npm run dev  # ‚ùå DO NOT DO THIS

# Test before migrating anything
npm test

# Check for Node.js dependencies before migration
grep -r "require('fs')" ../remotion-app/src/
grep -r "require('path')" ../remotion-app/src/
grep -r "import.*from 'fs'" ../remotion-app/src/
```

## Success Metrics for Migration

- ‚úÖ All valuable code successfully migrated
- ‚úÖ Zero Node.js polyfill errors
- ‚úÖ webpack configuration remains simple
- ‚úÖ Performance targets achieved
- ‚úÖ Original project safely archived
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth established
